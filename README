Compile: make
Run: ./newsh < testfile.txt

Program Description: The program acts as a shell (called newsh) which can quit, get rid of comments (%), run foreground and background commands, cd to a different directory, change prompt, set variable and replace them, and display background processes.

Limitations:
1. After not using C++ for awhile, one of the biggest limitations was time and myself. This means my program is probably not as efficient as it would be if I spent significantly more time on the project or had significantly more knowledge in C++.
2. The program can only do the above commands.
3. Background processes do not fork their own child processes.
4. Does not compile with .o
